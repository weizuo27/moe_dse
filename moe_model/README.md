1. To generate ILP solutions, run the following script. Please refer to the python file for specific parameter settings
    python run_flow.py -build_dir ./build
2. To implement the solution
    python impl_final_sol.py -ilp_sol [solution files generated from step 1] -ip_capacity [the percentage of allowed resources used in step 1 as constraints] -build_dir  [the build dir where the IPs should be generated in]
3. To collect the modeling metrics for the solution
    python generate\_modeling\_metrics.py -ilp_sol [the solution files generate from step 1] -ip_file_name [the ip candidate files generate by runing scipts in IP directory] -build_dir [the folder where IPs are genreated in step 2]

4. To generate the metrics based on final solution implmentation
    python parse_final_sol.py -ilp_sol [the solution file genreated from step 1] -expert_file [validation expert csv generated by running scripts from switch-base-8] -start_line 0 -ip_capacity [the allowed percentage of resources to be used] -build_dir  [the build dir where the final solution is implemented] -ip_candidates_file [ip candidate file generated by running scripts in IP directory]

5. To generate latency upper bound based on optimal solution per layer
   python generate\_lat\_ub.py #Please refer to the python file for configurations
6. To implement the IPs for optimal solution per layer
   python impl\_sol\_lb.py
